# Promotion of Equal Opportunities

The priority program SPP2137 offers dedicated funding for measures to promote equal opportunities. Typical examples include bespoke training or child care to enable participation in scientific conferences.

The financial support for measures promoting equal opportunities in SPP2137 is open to all members of the participating groups of the priority program ([see list](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/360506545)).

To apply for financial support of measures promoting equal opportunities in SPP2137, please send an informal request for approval to the head of the steering committee ([Prof. Christian Pfleiderer](mailto:Christian.Pfleiderer@frm2.tum.de)) stating:
* name of applicant
* affiliation of associated group participating in SPP2137
* planned activity or measure
* estimate of expected expenses 

The financial support is provided in the form of a reimbursement through the coordination project following completion of the activity. 

The allocation of funds will be on a “first come – first serve” basis until the budget available for these activities has been spent.
