#### 28 & 29 November 2023, Karlsruhe

A workshop on Numerical Methods for Topological Magnetic Textures will take place on 28 and 29 November 2023 in the Gastdozentenhaus of the Karlruher Institut f√ºr Technologie (KIT). 

The workshop serves as a platform for researchers who develop micromagnetic and atomistic simulation codes that are specifically designed for applications in the context of topological magnetic textures. 

The workshop is organized by Jan Masell (Karlsruhe) and Hans Fangohr (Hamburg).
