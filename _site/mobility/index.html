    <meta name="description" content="To promote synergies between the research groups contributing to the priority program SPP2137, dedicated financial support is available for travel expenses and accommodation of young researchers (students, PhD students, and postdocs).

The financial support serves to promote collaborations, training, and transfer of know-how by enabling visits in Germany. Visits must involve at least one of the participating groups of the SPP (see list). No funding can be made available for the participation of conferences or workshops, or visits of groups outside Germany.

Visits must be completed by 30 October 2023 at the latest. The financial support is provided in the form of a reimbursement through the coordination project following completion of the visit. Claims for reimbursement should be filed by 1 December 2023 at the latest.

To apply, please send an informal request for approval to the head of the steering committee (Prof. Christian Pfleiderer) stating:

  name of young researcher (applicant)
  names and affiliations of heads of groups involved (host and visitor)
  purpose of visit
  estimate of expected expenses


The allocation of funds will be on a “first come – first serve” basis until the budget foreseen for this activity has been spent.
